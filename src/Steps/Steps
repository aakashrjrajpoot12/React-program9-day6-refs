Using Refs
...........
-helps to determine the state of UI element
-an UI element can be provided a reference by adding "ref" attribute

<input ref="xxx">
ref refers to input element
to access the value : this.refs.xxx.value


Controlled elements & UnControlled elements
............................................
Controlled elements:React controlls it
UNControlled elements:Not controlled by react state and are handeled by DOM.
NOTE: use refs to access value from a uncontrolled component
.....
Q)Function based component -Controlled  or UnControlled ?
Function based component has NO state,NO state means UnControlled elements

NOTE:
......
*Function based component are UnControlled component
*Class based component are Controlled component
*By-Default you may not use ref attribute on function based component.because,they do not have instances

EG:
function Mycomponent(){
  return(<input/>);
}
class parent extends React.Component{
   getValue2 = ()=> console.log(this.refs.xxx.value);
    getValue1 = ()=> console.log(this.refs.yyy.value);
  render(){
    return(
      < input="xxx" onClick={this.getValue2} />. //this is fine
      <MyComponent ref="yyy" onClick={this.getValue1} />.  //this is not fine
      
      NOTE:By-Default you may not use ref attribute on function based component.because,they do not have instances
