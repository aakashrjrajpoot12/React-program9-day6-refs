Using Refs
...........
-helps to determine the state of UI element
-an UI element can be provided a reference by adding "ref" attribute

<input ref="xxx">
ref refers to input element
to access the value : this.refs.xxx.value


Controlled elements & UnControlled elements
............................................
Controlled elements:React controlls it
UNControlled elements:Not controlled by react state and are handeled by DOM.
NOTE: use refs to access value from a uncontrolled component
.....
Q)Function based component -Controlled  or UnControlled ?
Function based component has NO state,NO state means UnControlled elements

NOTE:
......
*Function based component are UnControlled component
*Class based component are Controlled component
*By-Default you may not use ref attribute on function based component.because,they do not have instances

EG:
function Mycomponent(){
  return(<input/>);
}
class parent extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.text=React.createRef();
  }
  render(){
    return(
      <input ref={this.text}/>       //No this is not a prop
      <MyComponent ref={this.text}/>         //we ant use like this as ,By-Default you may not use ref attribute on function based component.because,they do not have instances
    );
  }
}
